/**
 * Grid-like layout system.
 *
 * The layout object provides us with a column-style layout system. This file
 * contains the basic structural elements, but classes should be complemented
 * with width utilities, for example:
 *
 *   <div class="o-layout">
 *     <div class="o-layout__item  u-1/2">
 *     </div>
 *     <div class="o-layout__item  u-1/2">
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 *
 * The above will create a two-column structure in which each column will
 * fluidly fill half of the width of the parent. We can have more complex
 * systems:
 *
 *   <div class="o-layout">
 *     <div class="o-layout__item  u-1/1  u-1/3@medium">
 *     </div>
 *     <div class="o-layout__item  u-1/2  u-1/3@medium">
 *     </div>
 *     <div class="o-layout__item  u-1/2  u-1/3@medium">
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 *
 * The above will create a system in which the first item will be 100% width
 * until we enter our medium breakpoint, when it will become 33.333% width. The
 * second and third items will be 50% of their parent, until they also become
 * 33.333% width at the medium breakpoint.
 *
 * We can also manipulate entire layout systems by adding a series of modifiers
 * to the `.o-layout` block. For example:
 *
 *   <div class="o-layout  o-layout--reverse">
 *
 * This will reverse the displayed order of the system so that it runs in the
 * opposite order to our source, effectively flipping the system over.
 *
 *   <div class="o-layout  o-layout--[right|center]">
 *
 * This will cause the system to fill up from either the centre or the right
 * hand side. Default behaviour is to fill up the layout system from the left.
 *
 * There are plenty more options available to us: explore them below.

// By default we use the `font-size: 0;` trick to remove whitespace between
// items. Set this to true in order to use a markup-based strategy like
// commenting out whitespace or minifying HTML.

// Internal variable that contains the flex justifying options
$-zf-flex-justify: -zf-flex-justify($global-text-direction);
